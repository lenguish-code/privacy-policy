PRIVACY POLICY: LENGUISH (English Version)
LENGUISH PRIVACY POLICY

Last Updated: 8 november 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how \ ("Company," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, stores, shares, and protects your information when you use our language learning mobile application, LENGUISH (the "App").

By using the App, you explicitly consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy, including the processing and sharing of your data with independent third-party providers (such as Large Language Models and advertising partners) as described herein. If you do not agree with the terms, you must not use the App.

1. CRITICAL DISCLOSURE REGARDING THIRD-PARTY LLM PROCESSING
The App's core functionality requires sending your text queries and commands (User Content) to third-party Large Language Model (LLM) providers (e.g., Google, ChatGPT, DeepL, OpenRouter, and future providers) for immediate processing (translation, sentence generation, etc.) [User Query].

WARNING: We cannot control or guarantee the security, retention policies, or use of your User Content by these independent third-party LLM providers. By submitting User Content, you acknowledge that the LLM provider will process this data according to their own privacy policies. You must not submit any sensitive, personally identifying, or confidential information in your queries, as this information is transmitted outside of our secure server environment.

2. DATA COLLECTION AND USE
We collect different types of data based on your interaction with the App, defined into the following categories:

2.1. Identity and Authentication Data
We collect data necessary to create and manage your account and provide essential services.

Data Collected: Email address, Display Name/User Name, and a unique user identifier provided by the authentication partner (e.g., Google ID, Apple ID).

Purpose: Account creation, secure sign-in, service provision (Contractual Necessity).   

Source: Directly from you or via third-party authentication providers (e.g., Google Sign-In, Apple Sign-In).

2.2. User Content and LLM Processing Data
This data is essential for the language learning functionality and potential future synchronization features (AI chat, saved phrases).

Data Collected: Text queries (prompts) submitted to LLMs, the generated responses (translations, practice sentences), practice history, performance metrics, and saved learning materials.

Purpose: Providing the core service functionality, generating content, and future cross-device synchronization (Contractual Necessity).   

2.3. Technical and Usage Data
Data collected automatically regarding your use of the App to monitor performance and improve services.

Data Collected: Device identifiers (non-advertising), operating system details, device configurations, IP address, interaction logs (features used, time spent, crash reports, error data).   

Purpose: Service maintenance, analysis, optimization, and security (Legitimate Interest).   

2.4. Advertising and Tracking Data
Data used to deliver, measure, and manage advertisements within the App.

Data Collected: Advertising IDs (e.g., AAID), data related to ad impressions and clicks, and non-precise location information (if provided by ad networks).

Purpose: Delivering contextual or personalized advertisements and measurement [User Query].

Note on Consent: Contextual advertising is part of the essential business model (Legitimate Interest). Personalized advertising requires explicit, separate user consent (Consent).   

2.5. Transactional and Subscription Data
Data related to in-app purchases and subscriptions.

Data Collected: Subscription status (active/inactive), purchase history, transaction dates, and the type of subscription/bonus received.

Purpose: Fulfillment of subscription benefits and financial record-keeping (Contractual Necessity and Legal Obligation).

Disclaimer: We do not store or process sensitive payment information (credit card numbers, bank details). All payment processing is handled securely by the platform provider (e.g., Google Play).   

3. DATA SHARING WITH THIRD PARTIES
We share your data with the following categories of external, independent entities to provide our services and support our business model.

3.1. Third-Party Large Language Model (LLM) Providers
We share User Content and associated technical identifiers with LLM providers (Google, ChatGPT, DeepL, OpenRouter, and others) to generate the requested practice materials and translations. The processing of this data by the LLM providers is governed by their independent privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.

3.2. Advertising and Ad Measurement Partners
We share Advertising IDs and Usage Data with third-party advertising networks (e.g., Google AdMob, MeSTRo, and any future ad networks) for the purpose of serving, targeting (if consented), and measuring the effectiveness of advertisements. You agree that the App contains advertising as a condition of use [User Query]. Even subscribers may see limited contextual or threshold-based advertising.   

3.3. Authentication and Infrastructure Providers
We rely on third-party providers for secure authentication and cloud hosting/storage (for potential synchronization).   

3.4. Compliance and Legal Obligations
We may share data when required to do so by law, to enforce our policies, or to protect our rights and security.   

4. DATA RETENTION AND ACCOUNT DELETION
4.1. Deletion of Inactive Accounts (1-Year Rule)
We maintain a strict data retention policy. An account is deemed inactive if the user has not logged in or utilized a core App function (e.g., submitting an LLM query) for 12 consecutive months [User Query].

Deletion Process: Upon 12 months of inactivity, we reserve the right to automatically and permanently delete the user's account, including all associated Identity Data and User Content stored on our server. We reserve the right not to send additional notice before final account deletion.

4.2. Exceptions to Deletion
We may retain certain data even after account deletion, including:

Data necessary to comply with legal, tax, accounting, and audit obligations, which may require retention for minimum statutory periods (e.g., records of subscription purchases).   

Aggregated or de-identified usage data, which cannot be linked back to an individual, may be retained indefinitely for service improvement.

5. DATA SECURITY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
5.1. Security Measures
We implement commercially reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect your Personal Data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

Your use of the App and transmission of data is at your own risk.

The use of the App is also governed by our separate Terms and Conditions. This policy references the fact that our liability for damages (including indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from data loss or security breaches) is strictly limited to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.   

6. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS
The App operates globally, and data may be processed, stored, and transferred to countries outside your country of residence, including the United States, where laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction (e.g., the European Economic Area). We ensure that when Personal Data is transferred internationally, we rely on legally recognized safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), to protect your data.
